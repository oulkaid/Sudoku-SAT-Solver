# Sudoku-SAT-Solver
> Author: Oussama Oulkaid

## Roadmap
- [x] Build a Sudoku solver.
- [ ] Write my own solving algorithm through backtracking.

## Running the solver
Run the following command:

    python3 src/solver.py inputs/INPUT_X.txt

Where `INPUT_X.txt` denotes the file containing the Sudoku problem to be solved. 

For Example:

    python3 src/solver.py inputs/input_9.txt
